- **Goal**: Implement a speech-to-text conversion model using an RNN architecture.
- **Tools and Libraries**:
  - Python
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
